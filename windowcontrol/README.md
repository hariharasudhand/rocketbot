## Prerequisite

* Clone this repository into C:/Work/

# Note 

* This bot is strictly for a proof of concept of showing the capabilities of application opening using rocketbot and have some mouse interaction.
* Rocetbot has other options like ''' Rocketbot Desktop Recorder ''' which is used to mimic the human interaction with an application (i.e) it simply records the click of the mouse and records the keyboard press and gives a json file.
* All we have to do is just simply drag and drop the json to an empty rocketbot workspace and it will replicate all the human steps in rocketbot.
* ''' Rocketbot Desktop Recoder ''' Link : http://docs.rocketbot.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DesktopRecorder.zip
* Once Downloaded just open ''' Desktop Recoder.exe ''' From the unzipped directory.
